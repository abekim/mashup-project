# Mashup-Project: Foursquare & Youtube

a web app that mashes together the features of foursquare &amp; youtube

## Brainstorm

The current idea is to create an app that will allow users to check in at a location and return a list of videos related to that video. 

The only necessary model to implement the app is "location," whose attributes are name and address.

I'll start with a list of set locations, and work on the functionality of searching for videos related to the location. Once the functionality of the app is established, I will implement a user model with attributes name, current location, etc. Current location should be updated every 1 minute.

## Future Explorations
  
Find a way to search for "places near you" 
Implement a "favorite spots" feature
